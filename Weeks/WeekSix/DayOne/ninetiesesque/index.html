                <h2 id="intro">My Formative Years</h2>
                <p>I figure a good way to set up a 90s website is to talk about my life in the 90s! And what better format than the 
                    mess of a setup that a lot of services, like MySpace and AngelFire, let you set up? So below is what very well could have been
                    my geocities site when I was a kid.
                </p>

                <h2 id="redwall">Stories of Redwall</h2>
                <marquee><h1>Eulalia!</h1></marquee>
                <p>
                    The stories of Redwall were a series of books written by Brian Jacques.
                    They follow the inhabitants of Redwall through-out its long history. Redwall is an abbey set up for
                    the various creatures of the area, and plays a role in defense of the area.
                    <h4 id="brocktree">Lord Brocktree</h4>
                    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/32/Lord_Brocktree_US.jpg"/>
                    <p>Not the first book published, but the first book chronologically, it was the first book I read in the series. It is also, incidentally,
                        one of my favorite books. It might not be a masterpiece, but the story and characters still have a lot of emotional
                        significance to me and I've noticed over time that in most games I play, I try to recreate the titular character, Lord Brocktree.
                    </p>
                    <p>The story is roughly the origin of Redwall, with the Badger Lord, Brocktree, going on a quest to unite the disparate groups of critters in an effort to defeat
                        an army led by a wildcat named Ungatt Trunn.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="taggerung">Taggerung</h4>
                    <p>After Lord Brocktree, my memories of which books I've read go in and out. The last book I recognize 
                        the cover of is Taggerung. A young otter is raised in an outlaw band called the Juskarath. Tagg, the short name used 
                        for the character finds himself at odds with the often-times blood-thirsty band he is apart of. After ignoring the order of one of the leaders
                        Tagg is chased off leading to a long journey where he ends up at Redwall abbey, which is a common occurence for most peaceful critters in the area.

                <h2 id="dragonlance">Dragonlance</h2>

                <p>
                    Dragonlance is one of the older campaign settings for the Dungeons and Dragons game. Along with the Steampunk Eberron, Forgotten Realms and the O.G.s Greyhawk and Blackmoor, the world of Krynn 
                    was one of the more popular settings. For a period in the late 90s/early 2000s it was one of the more common settings.
                    The design of the world was always centered on the setting, which is easy to see in the novel settings. The characters all fall into archetypal D&amp;D race and class combinations.
                    The larger story arch is summed up as, a lot of fantasy was in the 90s, a fight between good and evil. Even in the deities of Krynn, you have the 'Good' deities, led by Paladine and the 'Evil' deities, led by Takhisis.
                    You have the 'Good', Metallic dragons (Silver, Gold, Copper, Bronze, etc...) and the 'Evil' Chromatic dragons (Red, Blue, White, Green, etc...). You have the 'Good' White-robe mages and the 'Evil' Black-robe mages, with the 
                    schools of magic associating with one of the 3 Moons: the white moon Solinari, red moon Lunitari and the dark moon Nuitari.
                    <h4 id="mainline">The Main-line Story</h4>
                    <p>The original story, starting from the first book published Dragons of Autumn Twilight, and fleshed out in the rest of the books, follows the Heroes of the Lance as they set out to thwart a religious group
                        from conquering the world. The True Gods of Krynn, led by the Gods Paladine, Takhisis and Gilean, have thought to have abandoned the world. The Seekers, claiming a new God has revealed themselves, are 
                        trying to rid the world of the worship of the True Gods. Through the novels, it's revealed that Takhisis hid Krynn from the rest of the Gods in an attempt to rule it herself. Through the novels, the Heroes of the Lance
                        thwart Takhisis and the True Gods are able to return to Krynn.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="twins">The Tales of the Twins</h4>
                    <p>Two members of the Heroes of the Lance, Caramon and Raistlin Majere, are two twins who probably couldn't be less similar. Fit and hardy, Caramon is a warrior of little equal. Raistlin
                        is a mage of dubious loyalties, who sacrificed his health for power. The Twins books follow the adventures of the Twins, almost culminating in the destruction of the world at the hands of
                        Raistlin's hunger for power.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="huma">The Legends of Krynn - Legend of Huma</h4>
                    <p>The Legends of Krynn are the fleshing-out of stories the main-line novels hint at. For instance, the Legend of Huma is the origin of the "Dragonlance",
                        the titular weapon used by the virtuous Knights of Solamnia to thwart Takhisis and her evil Dragonarmies. It follows Huma Dragonbane, as he will end up being called, as he travels throughout Ansalon to
                        find a way to stop an evil scourge that has been troubling the world. From a so-so Knight, to a legendary hero, this is another story that has particular emotional importance to me.

                <h2 id="rts">Warcraft and RTS games</h2>
                <img src="https://wowloretldr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lich_King-862x485.jpg" alt="Arthas, sitting on the Frozen Throne" height="300px" width="480px"/>
                <p>
                    It started in middle school, so a few years outside of the 90s, but pretty close. I first played StarCraft because a friend lent me a copy.
                    I enjoyed it enough that I got a copy for myself. I played it frequently enough that the first week back I had to get out of the habit of speaking
                    in internet-speech for my English classes. From StarCraft, I hoped over to WarCraft 3 and found my almost perfect setting. To this day, my favorite story
                    is the rise and fall of Arthas Menethil, Paladin of the Holy Light and Heir to the Throne of Lordaeron, even after Blizzard has spent decades trying to butcher
                    the story and setting. It's a tale that exemplifies the old quote from Nietzsche, 
                    <quote>Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster... for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you.</quote>
                    It is a timeless lesson, and the counter-point to the normal fantasy trope of the Knight in Shinning Armor. Arthas, so desperate to save his people from Chaos, that he sold
                    his soul and destroyed the very thing he wanted to save. The cinematics in Blizzard games are usually excellent, but the cinematic for the return of Arthas from Northrend hits especially
                    well.

                <h2 id="ttg">Tabletop Gaming</h2>

                <p>
                    With the interest in Real Time Strategy it was probably inevitable that I'd get into the precursor to it all: tabletop wargaming and roleplaying.
                    It started with Warhammer 40k in Middle School. One of my friends brought in the 4th Edition rulebook, and we spent lunch reading the lore and trying to learn the rules. We talked about 
                    starting a group for competitive play, but it never panned out. Warhammer is expensive...
                    <br />
                    From there, in High School, my next group of friends ended up starting a D&amp;D group, meeting on Fridays in a teacher's classroom. It started as a WH40k group, but grew into general geekery.
